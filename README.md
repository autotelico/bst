# Binary Search Tree (BST) – Self Study

This repository is a personal project dedicated to exploring and implementing Binary Search Trees (BST) in both JavaScript and TypeScript. It serves as a hands-on exercise to deepen understanding of tree data structures and their operations.​
## 📁 Project Structure

The repository includes the following files:​

    bst.js – A JavaScript implementation of a Binary Search Tree.

    bst2.js – An alternative JavaScript version, possibly experimenting with different approaches or optimizations.

    binary-search-tree.ts – A TypeScript implementation, leveraging static typing for enhanced code reliability.

    tsconfig.json – Configuration file for the TypeScript compiler.​

## 🚀 Features

Each implementation supports fundamental BST operations:​

    Insertion of nodes

    Searching for values

    Deletion of nodes

    In-order, pre-order, and post-order traversals​

## 🛠️ Getting Started

To run the JavaScript versions:

node bst.js
# or
node bst2.js

To compile and run the TypeScript version:

tsc binary-search-tree.ts
node binary-search-tree.js

Ensure you have Node.js and TypeScript installed on your machine.​
## 📚 Learning Objectives
