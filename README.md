# Binary Search Tree (BST) – Self Study

This repository is a personal project dedicated to exploring and implementing Binary Search Trees (BSTs) in both JavaScript and TypeScript. It serves as a hands-on exercise to deepen understanding of tree data structures and their operations.

## 📁 Project Structure

The repository includes the following files:

- `bst.js` – A JavaScript implementation of a Binary Search Tree.
- `bst2.js` – An alternative JavaScript version, possibly experimenting with different approaches or optimizations.
- `binary-search-tree.ts` – A TypeScript implementation, leveraging static typing for enhanced code reliability.
- `tsconfig.json` – Configuration file for the TypeScript compiler.

## 🚀 Features

Each implementation supports fundamental BST operations:

- Insertion of nodes
- Searching for values
- Deletion of nodes
- In-order, pre-order, and post-order traversals

Additional features or variations may be present in the different versions to explore various aspects of BSTs.

## 🛠️ Getting Started

### Run JavaScript version

```bash
node bst.js
# or
node bst2.js
```

### Run TypeScript version

```bash
tsc binary-search-tree.ts
node binary-search-tree.js
```

> Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) installed.

## 📚 Learning Objectives

This project aims to:

- Reinforce understanding of tree data structures
- Practice implementing algorithms from scratch
- Compare JavaScript and TypeScript implementations
- Explore different approaches to BST operations
